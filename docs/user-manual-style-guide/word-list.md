# Word List

This section contains a list of terminology we use in the User Manual. The following term usage also applies when writing or reviewing KBAs. However, other divisions such as Marketing or Sales may have conflicting style choices. Use best judgement or reach out to the team as necessary to discuss how to handle word choice for cross department projects. An easy example of this is that other departments, such as Dev may capitalize Tag, but tag is lowercase in the User Manual. 

For quick tips on usage, you can refer to the following rules:

* Gateway is always capitalized. 
* When discussing components, tags, modules, and containers, etc. only the proper names (when included) are capitlized. For example: Memory tag, Tab container, Tag Historian module, and Pie Chart component.
